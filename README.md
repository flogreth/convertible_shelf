# convertible shelf
a milled convertible shelf for 40x30 eurocrates

for [Tinkertank](http://www.tinkertank.de "wow!") i made an convertible 

we have the difficulty that we have quite limited space in the workshop, on the other hand we always want to present our tools as openly and accessibly as possible at workshops. To combine those two states in one furniture we build a shelf that can transform into a table. It also works with our well used eurocrates.
