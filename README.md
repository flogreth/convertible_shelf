for [Tinkertank](http://www.tinkertank.de "wow!") I made an convertible shelf/table inspired by [this one
](https://expandfurniture.com/products/shelf-table-convertible-bookshelf-to-table)

we have the difficulty that we have quite limited space in the workshop, on the other hand we always want to present our tools as openly and accessibly as possible at workshops. To combine those two states in one furniture we build a shelf that can transform into a table. It also works with our well used eurocrates.

### making of

first draft was done in tinkercad, where I even animated the kinematics to get the right distance between the boxes. Because that determines how high the boxes and their contents can be. And simulating is always fun. In Tinkercad you can also add earthquake to your simulation :)
